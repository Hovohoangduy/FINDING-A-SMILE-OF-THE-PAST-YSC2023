## FINDING A SMILE OF THE PAST
Description: Creating a video from facial images plays a
significant role in generating natural-looking videos from a
single image. We propose a method to create a short video
with natural facial movements of the lips, eyes, and related
facial parts using deep learning techniques, convolutional
neural networks (CNN), Hidden Affine transformation
combined with Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(cGAN), image processing technique and computer vision
methods. We will evaluate this method on CK-Mixed datasets
and compare it with other research methods.
